Built with:

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- IP Geolocation API by IPify
- React Leaflet
- Mapbox
- Netlify Functions

I ran into some issues with CORS while building this project and wrote a post about [how I solved it using a serverless function](https://gerardhynes.com/how-to-overcome-cors-with-serverless-functions/).
